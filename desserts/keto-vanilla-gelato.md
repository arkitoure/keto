# 🍨 Keto Vanilla Gelato (Authentic Italian Custard-Style)

Rich, dense, low-carb gelato made with real cream, egg yolks, and Tahitian vanilla.  
Perfect for skin, recovery, and keto-aligned indulgence.

## 🧾 Ingredients (Makes ~600ml total / ~4 servings)

- 400ml heavy cream
- 5 large egg yolks
- 60g xylitol or allulose (or ~1/3 cup)
- 1 tsp Tahitian vanilla bean powder (or 1.5 tsp extract)
- 1 tbsp MCT oil (C8 recommended) – optional for scoopability and keto boost
- 1 scoop (10g) collagen peptides – optional for texture and skin support
- Pinch of sea salt

## 🥣 Instructions

1. In a bowl, whisk egg yolks with sweetener until light and creamy.
2. Heat cream in a saucepan over medium until steaming (don’t boil).
3. Temper the yolks: Slowly pour hot cream into yolks while whisking constantly.
4. Return mixture to saucepan and cook on low, stirring constantly, until it thickens slightly (coats back of spoon).
5. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla, salt, collagen, and MCT oil. Mix until fully emulsified.
6. Cool the custard base completely (fridge for 4+ hours or use an ice bath for fast-chill).
7. Churn in your gelato/ice cream machine until thick and creamy (20–30 min depending on machine).
8. Transfer to 480ml paper container or airtight tub. Optionally freeze 30–60 minutes for firmer texture before serving.
