# Limoncello Ricotta Cake with Lemon Glaze (Keto-Friendly)

## Ingredients

### Cake
- 1/2 cup coconut flour
- 1/2 cup almond flour
- 5 large eggs
- 4 tbsp butter (Kerry Gold/Irish Butter has the best flavor), melted
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup unsweetened whey protein powder
- 400g ricotta cheese
- 1/4 cup fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 cup limoncello
- Dash of cinnamon powder
- Dash of vanilla powder
- 1 tbsp collagen powder
- 1 tbsp baking powder
- 1/2 cup powdered erythritol
- 1/4 cup Sukrin Gold

### Lemon Glaze
- 2 tbsp fresh lemon juice
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1 tbsp limoncello
- 1 tbsp lemon zest
- 1/2 cup powdered erythritol
- Flavor drops, optional but is a massive flavor upgrade (e.g., glazed donut flavor or lemon creme)

## Instructions

### Cake
1. Preheat the oven to 170°C (338°F) on a hot air/convection setting.
2. In a large mixing bowl or blender (like a Vitamix), combine the eggs, melted butter, heavy cream, ricotta cheese, lemon juice, limoncello, collagen, and powdered sweeteners. Blend until smooth.
3. In a separate bowl, whisk together the coconut flour, almond flour, whey protein powder, cinnamon, vanilla, and baking powder.
4. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, blending until well combined and smooth.
5. Pour the batter into a well buttered loaf pan or baking dish of choice.
6. Bake for 45-60 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out mostly clean with a few moist crumbs. (Adjust temperture lower if cake top is browning too fast)

### Lemon Glaze
1. In a microwave-safe bowl, combine lemon juice, cream, and limoncello. Microwave for 45 seconds to warm.
2. Gradually add powdered erythritol and lemon zest to the heated mixture, stirring until creamy smooth. (Be sure it does not become too thick but also not too thin!)
3. Add flavor drops, if desired, and mix well.
4. Generously drizzle the glaze over the cooled cake.
5. Let it set for at least an hour so that glaze is solid or set in the refrigerator for a 15 mins if in a hurry.
