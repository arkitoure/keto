Indulge in the delectable flavors and health benefits of these Keto Fried Mackerel Cakes. Made with mackerel in olive oil and fried in coconut oil, they're a perfect match for your keto lifestyle. For those craving extra texture, an optional coconut crust offers a delightful finish.

## Ingredients

- **2 cans of mackerel in olive oil**, drained and flaked
- **1/4 cup almond flour**
- **2 large eggs**, beaten
- **1/4 cup finely chopped green onions**
- **2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley**
- **1 teaspoon Dijon mustard**
- **1 teaspoon lemon zest**
- **1 tablespoon lemon juice**
- **1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper**
- **1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika**
- **Salt and pepper** to taste
- **Coconut oil** for frying
- **Unsweetened coconut flakes** (optional, for those who want a crust)

## Instructions

1. **Combine Ingredients**: In a large bowl, mix together the flaked mackerel, almond flour, eggs, green onions, parsley, Dijon mustard, lemon zest, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, smoked paprika, salt, and pepper until well blended.

2. **Form Cakes**: Shape the mixture into patties. If desired, press each patty into unsweetened coconut flakes on both sides to coat and create a crust.

3. **Fry the Cakes**: Heat a generous amount of coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Carefully place the cakes in the skillet, frying them for 3-4 minutes on each side or until golden brown and crispy. Monitor closely to prevent burning, especially if coated with coconut flakes.

## Serving Suggestions

Serve these flavorful mackerel cakes with a side of low-carb vegetables or a fresh salad for a complete meal. They pair wonderfully with keto-friendly sauces or a squeeze of fresh lemon for an extra zing.

## Nutritional Information (Approximate per cake)

- **Net Carbs**: Approximately 2-3g if coated with coconut flakes, slightly less if not. The bulk of the carbs comes from the almond flour and minor contributions from the other ingredients.
- **Fats**: High, due to the healthy fats from mackerel, olive oil, and coconut oil used for frying.
- **Protein**: Robust, thanks to the mackerel and eggs in the recipe.

Enjoy the rich taste and nutritional benefits of these Keto Fried Mackerel Cakes, tailored to fit your keto dietary needs with an optional crunch from coconut flakes.
