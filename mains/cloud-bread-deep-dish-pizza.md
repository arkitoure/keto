## Instructions

### 1. Preheat Oven
- Preheat your oven to **300°F (150°C)** to **350°F (175°C)**.

### 2. Prepare the Cloud Bread Base
- **Separate the eggs**: Whip the egg whites with a pinch of salt and **1 tsp of baking powder** until stiff peaks form.

- Gently **fold the whipped egg whites** into the yolk and cottage cheese mixture until fully combined.

### 3. Grease and Pour
- Grease a **pie dish** or **deep dish pan** with extra butter.
- Pour the cloud bread mixture into the pan, spreading it evenly. Gently push the mixture towards the edges if you want a thicker edge.

### 4. Pre-Bake the Base
- Pre-bake the base for **20-25 minutes** until it starts to firm up and the edges become slightly golden.

### 5. Add Parmesan Layer and Continue Baking
- After pre-baking, remove the base from the oven.
- Sprinkle a layer of **grated Parmesan cheese** (about 1/4 cup) over the base to help create a barrier and crisp the crust.

### 6. Add Mozzarella and Toppings

- Add more **grated Parmesan** on top to finish.

### 8. Final Bake
- Return the pizza to the oven and bake for another **10-15 minutes** at **350°F (175°C)** until the cheese is melted, the sauce is bubbly, and the edges are set.

## Notes and Tips:
- **Cheese Layering**: Adding a layer of grated Pecorino Romano in the base mix and Parmesan on top helps create a rich, savory flavor and keeps the crust from getting soggy.
- **Low-Moisture Mozzarella**: Use low-moisture mozzarella to reduce the amount of liquid released during baking.
- **Pre-Cook Toppings**: For additional toppings like mushrooms or spinach, pre-cook or blot dry to reduce excess moisture.
- **Broil for Crispiness**: To get the top layer extra crispy, broil the pizza for 1-2 minutes at the end of baking.
